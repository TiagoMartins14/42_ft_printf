# 42_ft_printf
Project developed during the Common Core @ 42 Porto

## ft_printf
Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() aren’t enough

### Summary:
The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf().
You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that??
It is actually pretty cool :)
